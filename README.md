# Campus Navigation Application  
An Application for Campus Navigation (CO7095 – Software Measurement & Quality Assurance)

##  Overview
The **Campus Navigation Application** is a Python-based system that helps students and visitors navigate a university campus by finding optimal routes between buildings. The application uses graph-based pathfinding algorithms, supports accessibility-aware routing, and includes searching and data-loading features.

This project follows Agile methodology with multiple sprints, user stories, branch-based development, and comprehensive testing (black-box, white-box, symbolic execution, and concolic testing).
